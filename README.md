# Text Classification with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to build, train, evaluate, and analyze a machine learning model for predicting authors and genres based on text data. It involves preprocessing the data, transforming it into suitable features, training the model, performing cross-validation for evaluation, and conducting error analysis to understand the model's behavior.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing the text data used for training and evaluation.
- `src/`: Directory containing the source code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and error analysis.
- `results/`: Directory containing the results of model evaluation and error analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and its components.

## Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Gather text data from a suitable source (e.g., Gutenberg corpus, online repositories).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing stop words, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Transform the preprocessed text data into numerical features using techniques such as Bag-of-Words (BOW), TF-IDF, and n-grams.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) on the numerical features to predict authors and genres.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using ten-fold cross-validation and calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Error Analysis**: Perform error analysis to identify characteristics of instance records that caused misclassifications and explore potential biases or confusions in the predictions.
7. **Documentation and Visualization**: Document each step of the process and explain the results effectively using graphs, charts, and textual descriptions.
8. **Verification and Validation**: Verify that the code runs without syntax or logical errors and validate the results against expected outcomes.
